## INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ##

1. What is configuration managemnet tool ?
2. What is vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config ?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ansible :  
 
 all the following process becomes automated with help of Ansible
 SERVER --> SOFTWARE INSTALLATION --> TOMCAT SETUP --> DEPLOYMENT 

its a free and opensource tool.
its an it engine which automates from server creation to deployment.
its is also called as configuration management tool.

configuration   : hardware and software properties of server (CPU,MEMORY,OS)
management      : what are packages going to install (UPDATE,DELETE,INSTALL)

ansible is invented bt Maichel dehaan in 2012. (free and opensource)
ansible is taken by RedHat (both free and paid versions)
We have both free and paid version of ansible.
it is platform independent.
ansible works with YAML language.
ansible dependency is python.
GUI for ansible is Ansible-Tower.
ansible is agentless.  (like for Ansible there is java-11 is agent here is no agent)

SSH protocol     : to connect two servers 

PLAYBOOK  : it is file which consist ansible code.
          : its a file which we are write the code to intsall softwares and deployment even the server creation.
          : If you want to any kind of work in ansible you need to write PLAYBOOK.
inventory file   : worker node information stored
--------------------------------------------------------
HOW IT WORKS ?
ARCHITECTURE:

ANSIBLE SERVER: used to communicate with worker nodes and install pkgs, deployment
WORKER NODES: takes commands from ansible server and works according to it
PLAYBOOK: conatins the code which is used to perform action.
INVENTORY: conatains info about worker nodes and group.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

for servers hostname is mandatory
Hostname : to identify the server

vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config    : it is file having properties of login of root user
                           : If root user login to other servers you need to modify this file on every server.

** yum package is not going to work for Ansible. **

                ansible all -a "yum install git -y"
                        |    |
                        |  for arguments
                 installing for all servers


SETUP:

CREATE 5 SERVERS (1=ANSIBLE, 2=DEV, 2=TEST)
ALL SERVERS:
sudo -i
hostnamectl set-hostname ansible/dev-1/dev-2/test-1/test-2     // for different servers give diff names hostname
sudo -i


// below all same for all servers
passwd root        // give same password for all servers (password is invisible)
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
(line 40 uncomment (PermitRootLogin yes), line 65 no=yes (PasswordAuthentication yes), line 66 comment (PermitEmptyPasswords no))
systemctl restart sshd
systemctl status sshd


ANSIBLE SERVER (main wala):
sudo yum install ansible -y             (// amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y)         // yum is not supported for ansible as per sir
yum install python3 python3-pip python3-devel -y     (// yum install python python-pip python-dlevel -y)
vim /etc/ansible/hosts (line 12 paste below code)    // If this file is empty dont panic stay with steps

make groups on line 12  : [dev] and [test]      // empyty file : make two groups

[dev]
172.31.44.19        // private ip of first dev server 
172.31.35.18        // private ip of second dev server
[test]
172.31.36.39         // private ip of first test server
172.31.43.36         // private ip of second test server

// all servers same time
ssh-keygen           # used to generate the keys 
enter 4 times
// in ansible
ssh-copy-id root@private-ip  -- > yes -- > password(given in above steps)             (ssh-copy-id root@private-ip_of_every_other_4_server_one_by_one )
ssh private-ip
ctrl d

NOTE: COPY THE KEYS TO ALL WORKER NODES BY USING ABOVE METHOD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. ADHOC COMMANDS
these are simple linux commands.
used for temporary work.
these commands will be over rided.

ansible all -a "yum install git -y"
ansible all -a "yum install maven -y"
ansible all -a "mvn --version"
ansible all -a "touch file1"
ansible all -a "ls"
ansible all -a "yum install httpd -y"             // httpd : Apache HTTP server
ansible all -a "systemctl restart httpd"
ansible all -a "systemctl status httpd"
ansible all -a "useradd raham"


INVENTORY HOST PATTREN:
ansible all --list-hosts                // list for all 4 servers i.e(dev & test) display its private ip
ansible dev --list-hosts               // list all dev servers
ansible test --list-hosts             // list all test servers
ansible test[0] --list-hosts         // list 0th index server i.e is 1st test server (test-1)
ansible all[-1] --list-hosts        // list second last server private ip
ansible all[1:3] --list-hosts      // list in between ranges servers


Verify that Ansible can connect:
ansible dev -m ping 
ansible test -m ping
