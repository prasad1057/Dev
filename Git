###  INTERVIEW QUESTIONS ###

1. Git is which generation of VCS ?     --> 3rd





***  Linux Torvalds    :    Invented LINUX and GIT also   ***

GIT  :  GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER (Globally you can follow up the information)

Git also called as Version Control System (VCS) & Source Code Management (SCM)

VCS  :  Controlling the source code of every version.
     :  it will keep the source code separately for each version.

Repository  :   Folder which contains the source code.

v-1   : 100 lines   ---->  store (repo-1)
v-2   : 200 lines   ---->  store (repo-2)
v-3   : 300 lines   ---->  store (repo-3)

Git : also called as * Chit *
        - used to track files
        - maintain multiple version of same file
        - platform independent  (run on any kind of platform)
        - free and open source
        - handle large projects
        - 3rd generarion of VCS
        - it is written on c language
        - it came on the year 2005


VCS History:

     SCCM                    RCS                          CVS                    SVN                         GIT
can track single      can track multiple        can track multiple      can track multiple files          Same as SVN but can access
file                  file & can't track        file and also track     and also folders and also         on multiple places
(1972)               folders but only single   folders but only one    multiple user can access              (2005)
                      permission is there       permission is there    source code placed on single
                                                                        place. (2000)


CVCS  :  CENTRALIZED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM.
Ex : SVN : it can store code in a single repository

DVCS  :  DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM.
Ex : GIT : it can store code in a multiple repository


ROLLBACK  :  Going back to previous version of application.
     (when current versionis not wokring then we are going to use ROLLBACK)


STAGES: (GIT ARCHITECTURE)
WORKING DIRECTORY : where we can write our source code.
STAGING AREA      : we track files here.
REPOSITORY        : where we store the tracked source code.



WORKING WITH GIT :
create a ec-2 server
mkdir zomato
cd zomato

yum install git -y        [yum=pkg manager, install=action, gir=pkg name, -y=yes]

git -v       : to check version
git init     : to intsall .git (local repo)   (If you dont have .git , your commands will not work )

to create file     : vi index.html  
to check file      : git status
to track file      : git add index.html
to store file      : git commit -m 'commit-1' index.html

create file --> add --> commit

to show commits                    : git log
to show last 2 commits             : git log -2
to show commits in single line     : git log -2 --oneline

----------------------------------------------------

git config user.name 'karan'
git config user.email 'karan2603@gmail.com'

NOTE : this user and email will be replicated to new comits only.

Git shoe : used to show the files which are attached to commits.
git log --oneline
git show commit_id
