## Interview Q ###
1. What is SSH?  -> Socket shell used to communicate eith servers
2. What is port number of SSH?  -> 22
3. How to show cpu information and memory information?
          -> CPU information = command : lscpu or cat /proc/cpuinfo
          -> Memory information = command : lsmem or cat /proc/meminfo
4. How to check server performance?  -> command : top or htop 

AWS : EC2 INSTANCES = ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD
TO CREATE EC2 WE NEED TO PERFORM 7 STEPS:

SERVER : COMPUTER
1. TAGS = NAME
2. AMI (AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE) = OS, SOFTWARE PACKAGES 
3. INSTANCE_TYPE = CPU & RAM
4. KEY_PAIR = LOGIN (public = managed by AWS , private = user)
5. NETWORK = VPC, SECURITY GROUPS (port number = 0-65535)
6. STORAGE = 8 GB - 16 TB
7. SUMMARY = TO REVIEW

OS = USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH SERVERS / SYSTEMS
TYPES :
1. Windows
2. Linux
3. IOS / MACOS

MODES :
1. GUI = Graphical User Interface
2. CLI = Command Line Interface

COMMANDS :
sudo -i                   : to switch from ec2-user to root-user
sudo su -                 : to switch from ec2-user to root-user
sudo su                   : to switch from ec2-user to root-user
logout (ctrl d)           : to switch from root-user to ec2-user
cat                       : to show the content of file
cat /proc/cpuinfo         : to show the cpu information
lscpu                     : to show the cpu information
cat /proc/meminfo         : to show memory information
lsmem                     : to show memory information
fdisk -l                  : to show volume/ROM information
lsblk                     : to show volume information
df // df -m // df -i      : to show volume information
ifconfig / ip addr / ip addr show / hostname -i  : to show the ip address

FILE COMMANDS :
touch file1           : to create a file
ls or ll              : to show the list of files
cat file1             : to show the content 
cat>>file1            : to write content in a file
enter ctrl d          : to save and exit from file
cp file1 file2        : copies the content from file1 to file2
mv file1 file2        : to rename file1 to file2
rm file1              : to remove a file
rm file1 -f           :to remove a file forcefully
rm * -f               :to remove all files forcefully
touch file{1..100}    : to create 100 files at a time
cat file1 >>file2     : to copy content from file1 to file2 (without overriding)
========================================================================
How to check the SERVER Performance:
top
htop : yum install htop -y

head file1  : shows first 10 lines a file
head -5 file1  : shows first 5 lines a file
head -15 file1  :show first 15 lines a file
tail file1  : shows last 10 lines a file
tail -5 file1  : shows last 5 lines a file
tail -15 file1  : shows last 15 lines a file
sed -n '5,15p' file1  : to print line5 to 15    (-n = numbers of lines    p = print)
wc  : to show lines, words & characters
