## Interview Q ###
1. What is SSH?  -> Socket shell used to communicate eith servers
2. What is port number of SSH?  -> 22
3. How to show cpu information and memory information?
          -> CPU information = command : lscpu or cat /proc/cpuinfo
          -> Memory information = command : lsmem or cat /proc/meminfo
4. How to check server performance?  -> command : top or htop 
5. For example there is a log file and in that i want to search an error how can i do it ?
          -> indirectly asked Q -> command : cat file_name | grep error(word) -i

** without user we can not login to server **

AWS : EC2 INSTANCES = ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD
TO CREATE EC2 WE NEED TO PERFORM 7 STEPS:

SERVER : COMPUTER
1. TAGS = NAME
2. AMI (AMAZON MACHINE IMAGE) = OS, SOFTWARE PACKAGES 
3. INSTANCE_TYPE = CPU & RAM
4. KEY_PAIR = LOGIN (public = managed by AWS , private = user)
5. NETWORK = VPC, SECURITY GROUPS (port number = 0-65535)
6. STORAGE = 8 GB - 16 TB
7. SUMMARY = TO REVIEW

OS = USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH SERVERS / SYSTEMS
TYPES :
1. Windows
2. Linux
3. IOS / MACOS

MODES :
1. GUI = Graphical User Interface
2. CLI = Command Line Interface

COMMANDS :
sudo -i                   : to switch from ec2-user to root-user
sudo su -                 : to switch from ec2-user to root-user
sudo su                   : to switch from ec2-user to root-user
logout (ctrl d)           : to switch from root-user to ec2-user
cat                       : to show the content of file
cat /proc/cpuinfo         : to show the cpu information
lscpu                     : to show the cpu information
cat /proc/meminfo         : to show memory information
lsmem                     : to show memory information

touch file{1..100}    : to create 100 files at a time
cat file1 >>file2     : to copy content from file1 to file2 (without overriding)
========================================================================
How to check the SERVER Performance:
top
htop : yum install htop -y

head file1  : shows first 10 lines a file
head -5 file1  : shows first 5 lines a file
head -15 file1  :show first 15 lines a file
tail file1  : shows last 10 lines a file
tail -5 file1  : shows last 5 lines a file
tail -15 file1  : shows last 15 lines a file
sed -n '5,15p' file1  : to print line5 to 15    (-n = numbers of lines    p = print)
wc  : to show lines, words & characters

i          : to insert command
A          : end of the line   (ensure that you are outside of insert mode)
I          : starting of line  (ensure that you are outside of insert mode)
O          : create new line above existing
o          : create new line below existing

1. COMMAND MODE :
gg               : top of the file
shift g          : last line of file
:set number      : to show number of lines inside file
cat -n file1     : to show the number of lines outside from file

GREP : Global Regular Expression Print

grep 'word1\|word2\|word3' file1  : to search multiple words at a time
cat file1 | grep karan  :
->   | : pipe symbol : here 1st command is the input for second command

==========================================================================
cat -n file1                           : to show the number of lines outside from file 

SED : STREAM EDITOR   (sed command will replace a word occuring in single time in line)
-> to used to replace the words in file.

sed 's/word1/word2/'                   : to replace word1 with word2
sed 's/devops/aws/;s/karan/prasad/'    : to replace multiple words
sed '2c who am i' file1                : to replace a line
sed -n '5,12p' file1                   : to print from line 5 to 12
  * Optional *
    cat file1 | sed -n '5,12p'         : to print from line 5 to 12
    cat -n file1 | sed -n '5,12p'      : to print from line 5 to 12 wtih index number
sed -n '10p' file1                     : to print particular line number 10 

:%s/word1/word2/        : to replace a word1 with word2 inside the file.   (% means filter out)
:%s/word1/word2/g       :  to repalce same word occuring multiple times in single line

=====================================================================================

users & groups :
to work with server we need to login as user.

Types of users : 
ec2-user    : default
root        : admin (he has all permissions)

useradd prasad    : to create a user
cat /etc/passwd   : to list users

Set of rules for creating a password :
1. it will not be exposed.
2. username will not be given as password.
3. min 8 character.


** If you want to give a permission on specific user you need to add in sudo file. **
** In sudo file, on line number 100 there is root user **
** sudo user means he having all the permissions **

visudo          : file contains users which they have permissions and we can edit those permissions 
su - karan      : switch on particular user

NORMAL TO SUPER USER :

useradd karan
passwd karan
visudo --> :100  --> yy & p --> root = karan --> save
su - karan
sudo useradd prasad
